 What Does "Time" Mean in Credit Card Fraud Detection?
In most fraud detection datasets (like the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset), the "Time" feature represents:

✅ The number of seconds elapsed since the first transaction in the dataset.

📌 Example Breakdown
If "Time": 0, it means this is the first transaction recorded
If "Time": 300", it means this transaction happened 300 seconds (5 minutes) after the first recorded transaction
If "Time": 86400", it means 24 hours have passed since the first recorded transaction
📌 Why Is "Time" Important?
1️⃣ Fraudulent transactions often happen in quick bursts

Example: A hacker makes 10 transactions in 5 minutes
Fraud models detect such high-frequency transactions
2️⃣ Unusual transaction times can be suspicious

Example: User normally transacts during the day
If a transaction happens at 3 AM, it might be flagged as fraud
📌 How to Use Time in Your Model?
If you're training a model, you can:
✅ Use Time Differences (e.g., seconds since last transaction)
✅ Convert to Hour of the Day (Time % 86400 / 3600) to detect night-time fraud

📌 Example Transactions
Time (Seconds)	Time (Hours)	Amount	Fraudulent?
0	00:00	$10	❌ No
200	00:03	$50	❌ No
30000	08:20	$5000	✅ Yes
50000	13:53	$30	❌ No
86400	00:00 (Next Day)	$7000	✅ Yes
🔥 Try different "Time" values and see how it affects fraud detection! 🚀

# 🚀 Credit Card Fraud Detection with Flask & Anomaly Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **Credit Card Fraud Detection** system built with **Flask** and **Machine Learning**.  
It uses **Anomaly Detection Techniques** to identify fraudulent transactions and sends **email alerts** to the user.  

🔹 **Tech Stack:** Flask, Python, Scikit-Learn, Chart.js, SMTP (Email Alerts)  
🔹 **Features:**
- ✅ Detects suspicious transactions using a trained ML model
- ✅ Sends **email alerts** for fraud transactions
- ✅ Displays fraud detection statistics using **Chart.js**
- ✅ Web-based UI for user interaction

## 📌 Fraud Detection Logic

### **1️⃣ What is "Time"?**
- `"Time"` represents **seconds since the first recorded transaction.**  
- High `"Time"` differences can help detect unusual transaction patterns.

### **2️⃣ How Does the Model Work?**
- The ML model analyzes **transaction amount & timing patterns**  
- It uses **Anomaly Detection** (e.g., Isolation Forest) to detect fraud  
- If fraud is detected, an **email alert** is sent  

### **3️⃣ How are Fraud Transactions Identified?**
| Time (Seconds) | Amount ($) | Fraudulent? |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| 500          | 20         | ❌ No |
| 30000        | 5000       | ✅ Yes |
| 50000        | 30         | ❌ No |
| 86400        | 7000       | ✅ Yes |
